            <p>
                ☛Muhammad was born on Rabi` Awwal 12, 570 CE, in Makkah. His dad passed away before he was born. A Bedouin wet nurse received the baby Muhammad and was tasked with raising him in the wholesome environment of the desert. Muhammad's mother, Aminah bint Wahb, took him back when he was five years old, but she passed away a year later. Muhammad then visited Abdul Muttalib, his paternal grandpa. After dad passed away when Muhammad was eight years old, his uncle Abu Talib raised the young Muhammad. He traveled to Syria with his uncle in a trading caravan when he was twelve years old.
                <br><br>
                ☛Muhammad was happy to work as a shepherd, but Abu Talib, his uncle, wanted more for him and got him a job with Khadijah bint Khuwaylid ibn Asad, a wealthy widow. Muhammad therefore found himself in charge of a caravan carrying goods to Syria at the age of 25. Upon his return, Khadijah was so happy with his handling of the business and drawn to his honorable demeanor that she dispatched her sister to propose marriage to the young man.
                <br><br>
                ☛Because Muhammad had been drawn to Khadijah, everything quickly fell into place. Their 26 years of marriage were filled with unmatched happiness. Muhammad kept on his business as a trader. His impartiality also bolstered his standing as "Al-Amin" (The Reliable). He kept becoming more and more interested in public affairs and worked hard to aid the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the impoverished.
                <br><br>
                ☛Muhammad withdrew to the seclusion of a cave on Mount Hira, outside of Makkah, whenever the transgressions of his people tormented him. In an attempt to bring order out of chaos, his spirit attempted to delve into the secrets of creation, life and death, and good and evil there. He developed an intense need for solitude, and each year he would spend the whole month of Ramadan mediating in the cave.
                <br><br>
                ☛Muhammad got the call at one of these instances when he was forty years old. Muhammad was given the order to preach by a powerful voice one night as he lay alone in the cave, lost in meditation. Muhammad awoke shaking and hurried home to seek comfort and rest from Khadijah's gentle touch, who soothed and calmed him. Later on, she conferred with Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a kinsman. He said that Muhammad had been selected as one of Allah's prophets and that he had received the same divine revelation that had reached Moses.
                <br><br>
                ☛The first person to embrace Islam's truth was Khadijah. Muhammad then shared his story with his close friend Abu Bakr, his adoptive son Zayd, and his cousin Ali. First among his close associates, then among his own tribe, and then in public throughout the city and suburbs, the Prophet began his mission in secret. The Kabah was a source of tremendous pride and wealth for their city, Makkah, and was guarded by the Quraysh clan. As a result, they were extremely frightened and started to aggressively dislike Muhammad.
                <br><br>
                ☛The Makkah people's hatred had no limits. Muhammad endured taunts, physical assault, and the worst persecution; his followers suffered the most unrelenting persecution, torture, and oppression. Muhammad then counseled them to depart the nation and seek safety among the Abyssinian Christians from the persecution of the idolaters during the fifth year of his mission. Muhammad and a small group of devoted followers endured much hardship and persecution while they were in Makkah, but their numbers kept growing.
                <br><br>
                ☛Muhammad was banished by the Quraysh, who also requested that his tribe give up their right to exact revenge. Following the Makkah people's order to cede their privilege, the arrogant clansmen were boycotted. Three years later, the prohibition was removed. Muhammad lost his uncle Abu Talib and his wife Khadijah a year later. The final restraint on the Makkans' violence was eliminated with Abu Talib's passing. Muhammad sought safety from the increasing severity of his persecution in the nearby city of Ta'if, where he encountered intense opposition and narrowly avoided death.
                <br><br>
                ☛Following a conference with his Makkan adherents, Muhammad decreed that they would relocate to Madinah. Gradually and quietly they departed, Muhammad staying until the very end. The Quraysh immediately learned of their departure and resolved to kill Muhammad before he could leave as well. As a result, they threw lots and selected forty men—one from each clan—who swore ominously to assassinate Muhammad. They were to attack at the same time to prevent any one clan from getting revenge for the murder. On the evening of his execution, however, Muhammad and Abu Bakr departed from Makkah.
                <br><br>
                ☛With his freedom to preach restored, Muhammad's following grew quickly. The Muslims could now freely practice their religion and live in accordance with Allah's rules. However, the Makkah community was determined to prevent Muhammad's movement from spreading to Madinah. They launched three massive attacks on the city, but each one was repulsed.
                <br><br>
                ☛In the end, the Makkans and Muslims came to an agreement in the Treaty of Hudaybiyah to uphold peace and behave impartially in their dealings with outside parties. The Muslims were to return to Madinah that year without making the pilgrimage, but they may come the following year when the Quraysh would leave the city for them for three days, as per the terms of the treaty.
                <br><br>
                ☛The Muslims were not able to terminate this conflict until AH 8, when the Makkans broke their treaty, and they triumphed over Makkah without using any blood. After 21 years of unrelenting persecution of Muhammad and his companions, the people of Makkah feared terrible retribution, yet when they were defeated, they were shown the greatest generosity. Muhammad declared them to be free and granted them amnesty for everyone. The Muslim call to prayer was heard in this historic sanctuary when the Prophet destroyed all the idols inside and outside of the Ka`bah, declaring, [The Truth has arrived and falsehood disappeared] (Al-Israa’: 81).
                <br><br>
                ☛As a pilgrim in AH 10, Muhammad believed his visit to Makkah would be his last because of a revelation he heard there that contained the line [This day have I finished your religion for you]. Al-Ma'idah: 3. Upon his arrival back in Madinah, he became sick with a fatal fever. He led the prayers for fifteen days, but three days before he passed away, he deputed Abu Bakr to take over.
                <br><br>
                ☛Muhammad left his chamber next to the mosque early on the final day of his life to participate in the gathering prayers, but he passed away later that day. The Prophet of Islam passed away peacefully on Rabi~ Awwal 12, AH 11, at the age of 63, amid murmurs of forgiveness and the companionship of the virtuous in Paradise.
                <br><br>
                ☛Following his passing, his adherents dutifully propagated the teachings of Islam, and in less than ninety years, the light of Islam made its way to China, India, the Caucasus, Spain, and North Africa.
